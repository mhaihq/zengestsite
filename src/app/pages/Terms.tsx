              HANA is a clinical workflow and patient engagement infrastructure platform. It is not a medical device, does not provide diagnoses, and does not prescribe or recommend treatment.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>HANA augments, not replaces, clinical relationships and human clinical judgement</li>
              <li>All AI-generated outputs are advisory and must be reviewed by a licensed clinician before clinical decisions are made</li>
              <li>HANA operates on a human-in-the-loop architecture: AI workflows are designed to escalate to clinical staff whenever uncertainty, risk indicators, or safety flags are detected</li>
              <li>HANA is not an emergency service. Patients in acute crisis are directed to emergency services</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Patients are always informed they are interacting with an AI system. HANA never impersonates a human clinician.
